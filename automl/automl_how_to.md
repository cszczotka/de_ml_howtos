## What is AutoML

Automated Machine Learning, aims to democratize machine learning by automating key stages of the ML pipeline—data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. AutoML handles these steps to enable data scientists and engineers to concentrate on interpreting results rather than on the intricacies of model development and tuning.

- Data Preparation and Ingestion
  
  AutoML starts with preprocessing data, which includes tasks like handling missing values, normalizing data, and detecting data types—whether they're numbers, categories, or text. This step is crucial because it sets the stage for accurate model training

-  Automated Feature Engineering and Selection

    One of the most time-consuming aspects of ML is creating and selecting features that improve model performance. AutoML automates feature engineering by identifying and generating features that are most predictive, thus speeding up the process while maintaining interpretability—especially important in highly regulated industries.

- Automated Model Selection and Training

  AutoML automates the selection of the best machine learning algorithm for a given task. It iterates over various algorithms and hyperparameters, using optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization to efficiently find the best model configurations, saving you from the usual trial and error

- Automated Hyperparameter Optimization

  Fine-tuning and tweaking hyperparameters can boost your model's performance but it's often a tedious job. AutoML automates this by exploring and optimizing hyperparameters through techniques such as grid search, random search, and more sophisticated methods like Bayesian optimization
